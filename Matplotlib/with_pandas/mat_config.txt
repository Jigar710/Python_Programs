matplotlib configuration
	Matplotlib has an expensive set of global parameters governing 
	figure size,plot spacing,colors,font size,grids...
	
	One way to modify the configuration programmatically from python
	is to use the rc method:
		for example to set the global default figure size to be 
		10 x 10 
			plt.rc('figure',figsize=(10,10))
		
		first argument of rc method is component you want to customize
		such as 
			figure
			axes
			xtick
			ytick
			grid
			legend 
			many more
			
		After that can follow a seq of keyword arguments indicating
		the new parameters.
		can also pass parameters using dict
		
		font_options = {'family':'monospace',
						'weight':'bold',
						'size':'samll'}
		plt.rc('font',**font_options)
		
========================================================================
seaborn package has several built in plot themes or styles
that use matplotlib's configuration system internally.

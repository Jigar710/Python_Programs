Scipy stats
	this modules contains a large number of statistical distributions,
	statistical functions and tests.
	
	There is also a very powerful python package for statistical modelling called
	statsmodels.

statistical tests
	Tests if two sets of (independent) random data comes from the same distributions.
	
	ttest_ind : calculates the T-test for the means of two independent samples of scores.
	This is two sided test for the null hypothesis that two independent samples have 
	identical average(expected) values.
	
	sci_stat3.py
	
	Since the p value is very large we can not reject the hypothesis  that 
	the two sets of random data have different means.
	
	To test if the mean of a single sample of data has mean 0.1 (the true mean is 0.0):
	
	sci_stat4.py
	
	Low p value means that we can reject hypothesis that the mean of Yis 0.1.
	
	sci_stat5.py
	ttest_1samp calculates the t-test for mean of one group of scores.
	This is a two-sided test for the null hypothesis that the expected value(mean)
	of a sample of independent observations 'a' is equal to the given 
	population mean.

Scipy Fourier Transform
	Fourier Transformation is computed on time domain signal to check its behavior in the
	frequency domain.
	
	Fourier Transformation finds its application in disciplines such as singal and noise
	processing,image processing, audio singal processing, etc.
	
	Scipy offers fftpack module, which lets the user compute Fast Fourier Transform.
	
	The FFT y[k] of length N of the length-N sequence x[n] is calculated by fft()
	and inverse transform calculated by ifft().

Discrete Cosine Transform
	A Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) expresses a finite sequence of data points in 
	terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies.
	
	Scipy provides a DCT with a function dct and a corresponding IDCT wiht the function idct.
	
	The inverse discrete cosine transform reconstructs a sequence from its discrete cosine
	transform (DCT) coefficients.
	The idct function is an inverse of dct function.

Scipy Cluster
	Generally not useful, people uses sklearn clustering package
	
	K-means clustering is a method for finding a clusters and cluster centers
	in a set of unlabelled data.
	
	Given an initial set of K centers, the K-means algorithm iterates the 
	following two steps -
		For each center, the subset of training points (its cluster) that is closer
		to it is identified than any other center.
		
		The mean of each feature of the data points in each cluster are computed,
		and this mean vector becomes the new center for that cluster.
